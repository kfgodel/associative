/**
 * This type represents a construct of a sensitive being that captures a pattern of perceptions as an identity in itself.<br>
 * A concept, as opposed to percept, is an abstraction of multiple percepts and other concepts linked together to form
 * an identity. The concept captures the identity of an external entity, but also its perceivable qualities.<br>
 * While the identity it's the reflected essence of an entity, the concept it's its meaning (that whcih gives value
 * to the identity).<br>
 * <br>
 * There are two basic types of concepts: relations and objects. Imagine them as different types of composites of identities
