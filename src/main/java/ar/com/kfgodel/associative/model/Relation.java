 * This type represents a concept that binds together two identities using a third one that acts as medium.<br>
 * A relation is a directed construct that has an origin and a destination identities, and a relation type which
 * is used to discriminate them.<br>
 * The relation type (the third identity), serves as an activator of the relations allowing to hide or show certain
 * types of relations while others are hidden.<br>
 * <br>
 * The relations are the elements from which objects are made. The object is discovered by its relations.
