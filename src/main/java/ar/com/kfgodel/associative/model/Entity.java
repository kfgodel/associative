/**
 * This type represents a concept that may not be used in the code, but it's important to capture in order to
 * discriminate it from Identity. An entity it's something that exists, something that is. Regardless of a subject perceiving it.
 * An entity represents something that is and has it's own qualities. From "entitas", a probable combination
 * from ens (is) + tat (quality of object).<br>
 * <br>
 * In the context of this project an entity is every object that represents things outside the associative memory.<br>
 * The associative memory creates interpretations of entities by using identities and relationships between them,
 * thus an identity it's a reflection of an entity captured by this memory.<br>
